Can you survive a potentially romantic meet-up with a Serial Killer?

Hello, this is my first time uploading my project to Github! 

The game is a text-based and choice-based adventure game. I intend to add a chatting-with-your-psychopath feature to it, but this feature is still under development. Currently the game is very under-developed because not all the storyline is complete. Will continue updating the project as the semester proceeds!
